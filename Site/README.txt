This app is to make learning japanese easier
The goal is to memorise japanese words with the help of spaced repetition
It is achieved with the help of a video game like user interface and a progress tracking system in a "collection" achievement form 
It is as much as a japanese learning tool as a web app developpement practice tool for me
Hope some people find it as useful as I do
I did my very best
